1
start runs debugged program until the beginning of main procedure
run starts debugged program and will go through the entire program until the error is found

2
to add the breakpoint in a function (say main), use the statement
break main
to add the breakpoint in a file at a certain line number, use the statement
break Driver.cpp:3 (to stop the program at line 3 of Driver)

3
the continue command resumes execution of the program until the next breakpoint or the error (seg fault, etc.) is reached

4
backtrace tells what current function we are currently in. With nested functions, there will be a lot of frames that will currently be sitting on the stack. Frames are where automatic variables for the function are stored so it will be very easy to have a lot of unneeded information appear with a backtrace command because of Object-Oriented Programming's tenet of encapsulation and helper functions. Recursion can also generate multiple function calls. ALso, with multiple errors, it will also be difficult to pinpoint one error at a time with all the frames on the screen at once.

5
print displays the value stored inside a certain variable.
info locals shows all the local variables on a current stack frame.
